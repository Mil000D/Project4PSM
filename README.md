# Rolling Spheres on an Inclined Plane Simulation

## Program Description
This repository contains a simulation program for modeling the motion of (full and hollow) spheres rolling on an inclined plane using the midpoint method for calculations.

The simulation results are presented in the form of numerical data that can be easily copied to Excel or other similar tool in order to visualize the results. 

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Adjust the input values as desired.
3. Run the calculations for either hollow or full sphere.
4. Copy the generated data to Excel for example to visualize the motion of the objects and energy variations.
